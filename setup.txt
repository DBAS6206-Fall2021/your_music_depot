Steps for Local Development:
	
	1. Clone the repo.
	
	2. Open via VS Code
	
	3. In the terminal, run "composer update"
	
	4. Set-up the .env file (You can copy/paste from blog project from Lab2 WEBD)
	
		4.5. In the terminal, run "php artisan key:generate --show". Copy and Paste the key from the
			 terminal into the .env file as the value for APP_KEY
			
	5. In the terminal, run "php artisan serve", at this point the app should run locally.
	
	6. Set up the remote connection for push/pulling to the repo run the following commands:
		git init
		git remote add origin https://github.com/DBAS6206-Fall2021/your_music_depot.git
		


Steps for Deployment:

	1. Login to Heroku and Begin Setting up a new App,
	   name it whatever you want but choose United States at the region.
	   
	2. For Deployment method choose "Connect via Github", Select our organization and 
	   then the repo for deployment.
	   
		2.5. Enable Automatic Deployments and the Deploy Branch. (The deployment wont work at this point)
			
		
	3. Create "Procfile" in the root directory of the App. Its contents should be:
	   web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/
	   Then Push the changes.
	   
	   3.5. May need to set up git remote run the following commands:
			git init
			git remote add origin https://github.com/DBAS6206-Fall2021/your_music_depot.git
			
			
	   
	4. In the settings of the Heroku deployment, open the Config Variables and Add two Entries
	   APP_DEBUG : true								// Helps with errors later on						
	   APP_KEY	 : *Paste the APP_KEY from .env*	// Must specify an encryption key

	   DB_PASSWORD 	: *Copy/Paste the password value
	   DB_USERNAME 	: *Copy/Paste the username value
	   
	   (Leave JawsDB_URL as is)
	   
	   
	4. In the Project Code, go to config/database.php and edit mysql connection 
		modify the line "'url' => env('DATABASE_URL')," so that it reads: "'url' => env('JAWSDB_URL','DATABASE_URL'),"
		
		
	5. Dont forget to also set all of the new connection variables in the .env, inluding adding JAWSDB_URL
