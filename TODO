- should we just make all of the tables have a model, controller, and be a resource?

- seed tables (not factory, the actual records for user_types, skill_levels, room_types etc...)

- update UserFactory.php, User.php, RegisterController.php, and register.blade.php to match our case

*** NOTE: registration does not work until we do the above ***

- run commands for tables that need to generate a model, controller, or are a resource
